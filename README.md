# ExCALIBUR
ExCALIBUR is a Python-written program designed to log on to several Dell servers, one by one using their iDRAC. Based on the MAC address for each server, the IP-addresess and the interface names are found. An ifcfg-file is then placed in the according folder with appropriate text on each server.

Full documentation and improvements/issues are disclosed in the README.pdf. We advice to read this whole document before using the program or developing it further.
